# Passport-To-Lifetime-Fitness
This was originally forked from Easy Node Authentication, mentioned below. Those templates were used for the authentication mechanism. See below for additional detail on this.

## Instructions and Usage
This app was designed for a program being piloted for a large urban school system. It is a partnership with organizations, such as the Boys and Girls Club, to encourage fitness in students. Students that are part of the pilot program participate in one of 4 activities. The app tracks their participation so the teachers can make better decisions.
